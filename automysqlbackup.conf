#=====================================================================
# Options documantation
#=====================================================================
# Set USERNAME and PASSWORD of a user that has the appropriate permissions
# to backup ALL databases. (See mysql documentation for details)
# NEW in 2.5.1:
# - If USERNAME is set to "debian" and PASSWORD is unset or "" obtain
#   them from the file /etc/mysql/debian.cnf
# - First command line option "-c" for configfile
# - Interpretable Exit-States:
#    1: given configfile is not readable or does not exist
#    2: unknown option
#
# Set the DBHOST option to the server you wish to backup, leave the
# default to backup "this server".(to backup multiple servers make
# copies of this file and set the options for that server)
#
# Put in the list of DBNAMES(Databases)to be backed up. If you would like
# to backup ALL DBs on the server set DBNAMES="all".(if set to "all" then
# any new DBs will automatically be backed up without needing to modify
# this backup script when a new DB is created).
#
# If the DB you want to backup has a space in the name replace the space
# with a % e.g. "data base" will become "data%base"
# NOTE: Spaces in DB names may not work correctly when SEPDIR=no.
#
# You can change the backup storage location from /backups to anything
# you like by using the BACKUPDIR setting..
#
# The MAILCONTENT and MAILADDR options and pretty self explanitory, use
# these to have the backup log mailed to you at any email address or multiple
# email addresses in a space seperated list.
# (If you set mail content to "log" you will require access to the "mail" program
# on your server. If you set this to "files" you will have to have mutt installed
# on your server. If you set it to "stdout" it will log to the screen if run from 
# the console or to the cron job owner if run through cron. If you set it to "quiet"
# logs will only be mailed if there are errors reported. )
#
# MAXATTSIZE sets the largest allowed email attachments total (all backup files) you
# want the script to send. This is the size before it is encoded to be sent as an email
# so if your mail server will allow a maximum mail size of 5MB I would suggest setting
# MAXATTSIZE to be 25% smaller than that so a setting of 4000 would probably be fine.
#
# Finally copy automysqlbackup.sh to anywhere on your server and make sure
# to set executable permission. You can also copy the script to
# /etc/cron.daily to have it execute automatically every night or simply
# place a symlink in /etc/cron.daily to the file if you wish to keep it 
# somwhere else.
# NOTE:On Debian copy the file with no extention for it to be run
# by cron e.g just name the file "automysqlbackup"
#
# Thats it..
#
#
# === Advanced options doc's ===
#
# The list of MDBNAMES is the DB's to be backed up only monthly. You should
# always include "mysql" in this list to backup your user/password
# information along with any other DBs that you only feel need to
# be backed up monthly. (if using a hosted server then you should
# probably remove "mysql" as your provider will be backing this up)
# NOTE: If DBNAMES="all" then MDBNAMES has no effect as all DBs will be backed
# up anyway.
#
# If you set DBNAMES="all" you can configure the option DBEXCLUDE. Other
# wise this option will not be used.
# This option can be used if you want to backup all dbs, but you want 
# exclude some of them. (eg. a db is to big).
#
# Set CREATE_DATABASE to "yes" (the default) if you want your SQL-Dump to create
# a database with the same name as the original database when restoring.
# Saying "no" here will allow your to specify the database name you want to
# restore your dump into, making a copy of the database by using the dump
# created with automysqlbackup.
# NOTE: Not used if SEPDIR=no
#
# The SEPDIR option allows you to choose to have all DBs backed up to
# a single file (fast restore of entire server in case of crash) or to
# seperate directories for each DB (each DB can be restored seperately
# in case of single DB corruption or loss).
#
# To set the day of the week that you would like the weekly backup to happen
# set the DOWEEKLY setting, this can be a value from 1 to 7 where 1 is Monday,
# The default is 6 which means that weekly backups are done on a Saturday.
#
# COMP is used to choose the copmression used, options are gzip or bzip2.
# bzip2 will produce slightly smaller files but is more processor intensive so
# may take longer to complete.
#
# COMMCOMP is used to enable or diable mysql client to server compression, so
# it is useful to save bandwidth when backing up a remote MySQL server over
# the network. 
#
# LATEST is to store an additional copy of the latest backup to a standard
# location so it can be downloaded bt thrid party scripts.
#
# If the DB's being backed up make use of large BLOB fields then you may need
# to increase the MAX_ALLOWED_PACKET setting, for example 16MB..
#
# When connecting to localhost as the DB server (DBHOST=localhost) sometimes
# the system can have issues locating the socket file.. This can now be set
# using the SOCKET parameter.. An example may be SOCKET=/private/tmp/mysql.sock
#
# Use PREBACKUP and POSTBACKUP to specify Per and Post backup commands
# or scripts to perform tasks either before or after the backup process.
#
#
#=====================================================================
# Backup Rotation..
#=====================================================================
#
# Daily Backups are rotated weekly..
# Weekly Backups are run by default on Saturday Morning when
# cron.daily scripts are run...Can be changed with DOWEEKLY setting..
# Weekly Backups are rotated on a 5 week cycle..
# Monthly Backups are run on the 1st of the month..
# Monthly Backups are rotated on a 5 month cycle...
# It may be a good idea to copy Monthly backups offline or to another
# server..
#
#=====================================================================
# Please Note!!
#=====================================================================
#
# I take no resposibility for any data loss or corruption when using
# this script..
# This script will not help in the event of a hard drive crash. If a 
# copy of the backup has not be stored offline or on another PC..
# You should copy your backups offline regularly for best protection.
#
# Happy backing up...
#
#=====================================================================
# Restoring
#=====================================================================
# Firstly you will need to uncompress the backup file.
# eg.
# gunzip file.gz (or bunzip2 file.bz2)
#
# Next you will need to use the mysql client to restore the DB from the
# sql file.
# eg.
# mysql --user=username --pass=password --host=dbserver database < /path/file.sql
# or
# mysql --user=username --pass=password --host=dbserver -e "source /path/file.sql" database
#
# NOTE: Make sure you use "<" and not ">" in the above command because
# you are piping the file.sql to mysql and not the other way around.
#
# Lets hope you never have to use this.. :)
